# 📝 Registration Forms Collection

This project showcases a variety of HTML-based registration forms demonstrating different input types, validation techniques, and form controls. It serves as a reference for beginners learning HTML forms and frontend form design.

## 📁 Project Structure

The main file is:

- `index.html` – Contains seven distinct registration forms, each illustrating different HTML form features.

## 📋 Forms Overview

Each form is wrapped in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` title for clarity:

| Form | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Form 1.1** | Basic form with text, email, password, number, and telephone inputs. |
| **Form 1.2** | Adds `required`, `maxlength`, and `minlength` attributes for validation. |
| **Form 1.3** | Redirects to `p1.html` upon submission. |
| **Form 1.4** | Includes radio buttons for gender selection. |
| **Form 1.5** | Uses checkboxes to select multiple cities. |
| **Form 1.6** | Adds date picker, color selector, range slider, search bar, and file upload. |
| **Form 1.7** | Extends Form 1.6 with a `datalist` for browser suggestions. |
